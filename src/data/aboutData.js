  description1:
    "Ambitious, energetic, aspiring software developer. I have a big passion for what I do and enjoy continuously learning about new technologies, frameworks, stacks and methods of tackling different solutions. I have a wide berth of experience with various programming languages but I have been finding my home most with Java and it's related languages like Kotlin and Clojure and can foresee a career working with that language. However I do pride myself in being malleable and able to quickly catch on what is required for the task, project or job, so that is not to say that I am one trick pony in that regard.  I returned to school as a non-traditional student, which has presented it's own unique privilege's and challenges, however I have found much personal satisfaction in being able to academically engage with my peers as we work and produce great things together.",
  description2: "I of course look forward to applying all of that philosophy and ethic to working for your organization. I don't keep much a secret, feel free to take a look around at some of my projects and playthings, or connect and let's network.",
